## Helper Commands

In the project directory, you can run:
- `npm start` - Runs the app in the development mode.
- `npm test` - Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.
- `npm run build` - Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.
- `npm run eject` - If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.
